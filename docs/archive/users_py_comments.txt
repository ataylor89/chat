##### Original text #####

# The acronym DAO stands for "data access object"

# It's a paradigm that I often use when I write code that accesses a database

# In the previous iteration, I decided to make this module stateless
# But in this iteration, I changed my mind, and decided to make this module stateful

# What do the words state, stateful, and stateless mean?

# State refers to persistent data

# A module (or API) is stateful if it has persistent data
# A module (or API) is stateless if it does not have persistent data

# The word also gets used in object-oriented programming

# Objects are said to have state and behavior

# State refers to an object's data (which is persistent)
# Behavior refers to an object's methods

# In conclusion, we have defined the word "state" in two ways

# In a more general context, state refers to persistent data
# In the context of object-oriented programming, state refers to an object's data

# I wanted to write this brief introduction before we proceed with the code
